edward.js
=========

Presentation tool written in Javascript. Uses jQuery for the javascript main codebase, and CSS for theming and styling.


Install and usage
-----------------

Get the source, edward.js, and include it in your html file. The source code of index.html is a good example to see how
the library is included and the slides content is implemented. You can see style.css for theming ideas. The basics are,
you must have a container element, and inside that, one or more <article> tags, containing the slides of your presentation.
You can style the presentation with css, but keep in mind that the dimensions of the slides are contrained by the container
element. Again, see the demo HTML for reference.

Once your markup is ready, the presentation is initialized with the call

```javascript
Edward.init('#container')
```

where '#container' is a jQuery selector of your presentation container DOM element.
